                            target="_blank"><span>profiling</span></a> tool, which allows you to analyze <a
                            href="http://linkeddata.org/" target="_blank"><span>Linked Open Data (LOD)</span></a>
                        and thus helps you to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying structure and semantics.
                    </p>

                        <p> LOD is data published on the Web adhering to a set of <a
                                href="http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html" target="_blank"><span>design principles</span></a>.
                            There is a notable growth of such LOD sources, which provide a wealth of information.
                            Usually, these data sets are very large (millions of facts) and often heterogeneous
                            (e.g. have a loose structure or are poorly formatted, etc.). This heterogeneity causes
                            potential data quality issues. ProLOD++ helps to identify these problems.
                        </p>

                        <p>ProLOD++ is able to process arbitrary LOD sources by analyzing N-Triple dump files
                            containing all information of a data set. Currently, the access to this automated analysis is not
                            publicly available, i.e., you cannot upload NT files to be analyzed. However, if you are
                            interested in profiling a specific data set, feel free to contact us. Also, you are
                            welcome to play with the data sources we already uploaded, e.g., DBpedia and LinkedMDB. Your
                            feedback is appreciated.</p></div>
