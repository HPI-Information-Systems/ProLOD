        <ul>
          <li>
            Split the <code>FileUpload</code> class into an abstract base class
            and two concrete classes, one of which is specific to a disk-based
            repository and the other a more generic implementation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Replaced the ad hoc <code>newInstance()</code> means of creating
            <code>FileItem</code> instances with a factory-based scheme for
            much greater flexibility and simpler customization. This change
            also eliminates a dependency on Commons BeanUtils.
          </li>
          <li>
            Change the semantics of the size threshold to apply to the size of
            individual items, instead of the size of the overall request. This
            is in line with the original documentation, and better meets user
            expectations.
          </li>
          <li>
            Added unit tests for exceptional conditions, and to test new
            functionality.

          <li>
            In the <code>FileItem</code> interface, the <code>setIsFormField()</code>
            method has been replaced by the <code>setFormField()</code> method.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the <code>FileItem</code> interface, the <code>write(String)</code>
            method has been replaced by the <code>write(File)</code> method.
          </li>
          <li>
            The <code>sizeThreshold</code> property of the <code>FileUpload</code>
            class has been moved to the <code>DiskFileUpload</code> class.
          </li>
          <li>
            The <code>repositoryPath</code> property of the <code>FileUpload</code>
            class has been moved to the <code>DiskFileUpload</code> class.
          </li>
          <li>
            The disk-specific <code>parseRequest()</code> method of the
            <code>FileUpload</code> class has been moved to the
            <code>DiskFileUpload</code> class.

        <ul>
          <li>
            <code>FileItem.newInstance()</code> has been replaced by the use of
            factories to create new <code>FileItem</code> instances.
          </li>
          <li>
            The <code>storeLocation</code> property of the <code>FileItem</code>
            interface has been removed, since it is (disk-based) implementation
            specific.

        <ul>
          <li>
            The <code>sizeThreshold</code> property now applies to the size of
            each item, rather than the size of the request as a whole. This is
            more in keeping which user expectations, as well as matching the
            original documentation.
