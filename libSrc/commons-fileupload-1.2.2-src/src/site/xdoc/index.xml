      <p>
        The Commons <strong>FileUpload</strong> package makes it easy to add
        robust, high-performance, file upload capability to your servlets and
        web applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        FileUpload parses HTTP requests which conform to
        <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1867.txt">RFC 1867</a>,
        "Form-based File Upload in HTML". That is, if an HTTP request is
        submitted using the POST method, and with a content type of
        "multipart/form-data", then FileUpload can parse that request, and
        make the results available in a manner easily used by the caller.

        Please remember that the lists are shared between all commons components,
        so prefix your e-mail subject line with <em>[fileupload]</em>.
